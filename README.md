#pixelpy
PixelPy is a tool to make it easier to label pixel coordinates of areas in images. This was written specifically to label 
the positions of items within visual scenes so that this data could then be used to configure an eyetracking experiment.

##Configuration
Before you can use PixelPy, you have to figure configure it to work with the directories you want. It's pretty easy to configure... I've included a sample
configuration file that works with the included sample.

##Usage

```python pixelpy.py```

This will open up a separate GUI window.
